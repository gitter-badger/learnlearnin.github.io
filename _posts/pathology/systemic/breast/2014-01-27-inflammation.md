Mast - breast, itis - inflammation

The breasts are usually well protected inside several layers of clothing and so inflammation is rare. It's so rare that if women present with erythematous swollen painful breast, inflammatory breast cancer must be suspected rather than an inflammation as such.

So, when are the only times these mounts are vulnerable?

* Breast feeding
Acute Mastitis
--------------
Baby sucks --> cracks and fissures in the nipple --> Staph aureus or Streptococci invade one duct system --> untreated it spreads to the entire breast 

Staph aureus is specialized in forming abscesses, whereas streptococcus (which is the first cause for cellulitis elsewhere) causes a diffuse spreading infection.

Since it's acute there will be neutrophil invasion.

* Surgery or breast trauma
Fat necrosis
-----
Breast is full of fat, and surgeons rarely spare the fat when they operate. Thus, there's necrosis 

* Piercing, etc
Granulomatous mastitis
----
Remember TB?

* autoimmune? (Because our body's crazy)
Lymphocytic mastopathy (Sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis)
-------
Lymphocytes, they surround the small vessels and epithelium. And the stroma around ducts and lobules start collagenizing - becoming palpable masses.

* no reason :P
Mammary Duct Ectasia
--------
This should be differentiated from periductal below.

Periductal Mastitis
----------
This is associated with smoking. But nobody knows why :P
