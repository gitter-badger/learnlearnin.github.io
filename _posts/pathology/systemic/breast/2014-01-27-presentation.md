#How women come to doctors
* ## Pain
Like every part of the body, pain is the first thing people can't resist for a long time
* ## Palpable mass
This might probably be detected by their husbands. Apart from that, advertisements about breast cancer are driving home the message that women need to keep touching their breasts and looking for masses
* ## Lumpiness
This is slightly different from having a mass. Breast is naturally nodular. And young women might misunderstand this and reach gynecologists.
* ## Nipple discharge
Since breasts are designed to secrete, one thing that happens when there is something wrong inside a breast is, increased discharge from the exit hole
