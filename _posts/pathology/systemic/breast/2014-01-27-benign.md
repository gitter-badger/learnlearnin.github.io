These can immediately be divided into [proliferative](proliferative) and [non-proliferative](nonproliferative) changes based on their associated risk with cancer.

Non-proliferative changes are called fibrocystic changes becuase there's either fibrosis or cyst formation or adenosis. (I don't know why they aren't called fibrocystoadenotic changes :P)
